SoccerCoins repositry:

This repositry has been created to promote and manage the SoccerCoins project. The goal is to create an investment pool to aquire assets in professional football including buying clubs across Europe and representation rights for professional players.

The project is incepted May 16th 2018 and is in PRE PRE ICO phase now with three subsequent tiers set up to raise funds to progress plans and take ownership of infrastructure.

The smart contract will be developed to allow for payment of profits to coin holders quarterly and also for voting mechanisms to be established for the day to day input of members into decisions ranging from transfers to kit deals etc. 

We intend for the project to be interactive and allow participants to enjoy their share of the football profits whilst also getting involved in the running of the clubs and setting strategy and direction for the group.

Ultimate goal is to take one of the aquired clubs debt free to the upper levels of European football within the next ten years.
